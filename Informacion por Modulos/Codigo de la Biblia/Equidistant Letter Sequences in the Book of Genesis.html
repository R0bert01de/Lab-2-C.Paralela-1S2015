<p>
ABSTRACT. It has been noted that when the Book of Genesis is written
as two-dimensional arrays, equidistant letter sequences spelling words
often appear in close proximity with portions of the text which have related
meaning. Quantitative tools for measuring this phenomenon are developed.
Randomization analysis is done for three samples. For one of them the effect
is significant at the level of .000000004.

<h3>
<b>1. Introduction.</b></h3>
There is an old Jewish tradition about a "hidden text" in the Hebrew Pentateuch
(the Five Books of Moses), consisting of words or phrases expressed in
the form of equidistant letter sequences (ELS's) -- that is by selecting
sequences of equally spaced letters in the text. Since this tradition was
passed orally, only few expressions that belong to the "hidden text" were
preserved in writing (Rabbenu Bahya, 1492 and Cordovero, 1592); actually
almost all the words and the syntax are unknown. Rabbi H.M.D. Weissmandel
(Weissmandel, 1958) was the first to try to show the existence of such
a "hidden text", by finding interesting patterns consisting of ELS's.

<p>In a previous paper (Witztum <i>et al</i>, 1994), we developed a methodology
for systematic and rigorous studies of the same nature; namely, for attempts
to show objectively the existence of the"hidden text" in the Hebrew Pentaceuch.
This methodology was applied to study the "hidden text" of the Book of
Genesis.

</p><p>The approach we have taken in our research can be illustrated by the
following example. Suppose we have a text written in a foreign language
that we do not understand. We are asked whether the text is meaningful
(in that foreign language) or meaningless. Of course, it is very difficult
to decide between these possibilities, since we do not understand the language.
Suppose now that we are equipped with a very partial dictionary, which
enables us to recognise a small portion of the words in the text: "hammer"
here and "chair" there, and maybe even "umbrella" elsewhere. Can we now
decide between the two possibilitities?

</p><p>Not yet. But suppose now that, aided with the partial dictionary, we
can recognise in the text a pair of conceptually related words, like "hammer"
and "anvil". We check if there is a tendency of their appearances in the
text to be in "close proximity". If the text is meaningless, we do not
expect to see such a tendency, since there is no reason for it to occur.
Next, we widen our check; we may identify some other pairs of conceptually
related words: like "chair" and "table", or "rain" and "umbrella". Thus
we have a sample of such pairs, and we check the tendency of each pair
to appear in close proximity in the text. If the text is meaningless, there
is no reason to expect such a tendency. However, a strong tendency of such
pairs to appear in close proximity indicates that the text might be meaningful.

</p><p>Note that even in an absolutely meaningful text we do not expect that,
deterministically, every such pair will show such tendency. Note also,
that we did not decode the foreign language of the text yet: we do not
recognise its syntax and we cannot read the text.

</p><p>In our research we consider the set of all ELS's spelling out words
or phrases in the language of the text. The approach described in this
example suggests the two following lines of investigation:

</p><p>A) A study of the mutual location of ELS's spelling out conceptually
related words or expressions.

</p><p>B) A study of the mutual location of ELS's spelling out words or expressions
with conceptually related portions of the text.

</p><p>Suppose we are given a text, such as Genesis (<i>G</i>). Define an <i>ELS
</i>(equidistant letter sequence) as a sequence of letters in the text
whose positions, not counting spaces, form an arithmetic progression; that
is, the letters are found at the positions
</p><center><i>n, n+d, n+</i>2<i>d,..., n+(k-</i>1<i>)d.</i></center>

<p>We call <i>d </i>the <i>skip,</i> <i>n </i>the <i>start</i>, and <i>k
</i>the <i>length </i>of the ELS. These three parameters uniquely identify
the ELS, which is denoted (<i>n, d, k</i>).

</p><p>Let us write the text as a two-dimensional array -- i.e., on a single
large page -- with rows of equal length, except perhaps for the last row.
Usually, then, an ELS appears as a set of points on a straight line. The
exceptional cases are those where the ELS "crosses" one of the vertical
edges of the array and reappears on the opposite edge. To include these
cases in our framework, we may think of the two vertical edges of the array
as pasted together, with the end of the first line pasted to the beginning
of the second, the end of the second to the beginning of the third, and
so on. We thus get a cylinder on which the text spirals down in one long
line.

</p><p>It has been noted that when Genesis is written in this way, and the
distance between ELS's is defined according to the ordinary two-dimensional
Euclidean metric -- ELS's spelling words with related meaning often appear
in close proximity. It has also been noted that ELS's spelling words often
appear in close proximity with portions of the text which have related
meaning.

</p><p>Thus, our research focuses on two phenomena:
</p><h4>
<b>Phenomenon A</b></h4>
The appearance of "noteworthy" ELS's spelling words with related meanings
in close proximity, on two-dimensional arrays. (the "noteworthy" ELS's
are those for which the skip |<i>d</i>| is minimal on the whole text, or
on large parts of it; for short we call them <i>minimal </i>ELS's).

<p>Our paper (Witztum <i>et al</i>., 1994) deals with Phenomenon A. There
we developed a method for testing the significance of the phenomenon according
to accepted statistical principles. After making certain choices of words
to compare and ways to measure proximity, we performed a randomization
test and obtained a very small p-value, i.e. we found the results highly
statisically significant.
</p><h4>
<b>Phenomenon B</b></h4>
The appearance of minimal ELS's spelling words in close proximity, on two-dimensional
arrays, with conceptually related words or expressions appearing in the
string of letters of the text: i.e. with skip&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/plus1.gif" height="10" width="11" align="BOTTOM">1.
<h4>
Example</h4>
On <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/figures.html#figure1">Figure 1</a> we see a pair of words:
the word&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/prat.gif" height="9" width="45" align="BOTTOM"> (private)
appearing as an ELS (with skip 855) with the word&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/shamot.gif" height="10" width="35" align="BOTTOM">
(names) appearing in the text (Gn 26:18).

<p>Each ELS determines a series of tables with row lengths <i>h</i>= <i>h</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>h</i><sub>2</sub>,..., where <i>h</i><sub>i</sub> is the integer nearest
to |<i>d</i>|/<i>i</i> (1/2 is rounded up).

</p><p>The rows in our table has 428 letters (only 21 of them are shown in
Figure 1). The number 428 is the nearest integer to 855/2, so the word&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/prat.gif" height="9" width="45" align="BOTTOM">
(private) appears every second row.

</p><p>The table is determined by this ELS of the word&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/prat.gif" height="9" width="45" align="BOTTOM">
(private), which is minimal in a section of the text comprising 76% of
<i>G</i>. The word&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/shamot.gif" height="10" width="35" align="BOTTOM">
(names) appears in the text of <i>G</i> seven times as SL's. Note that <i>G</i>
contains 78,064 letters.
More examples are given in <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.3.1">Appendix A.3.1</a>.

</p><p>The measuring scheme for Phenomenon A (see Witztum <i>et al</i>., 1994)
is applicable, with minor changes, to study Phenomenon B.

</p><p>In this paper we make certain choices of words to compare and perform
similar randomization tests. We obtain very small p-values; that is, we
find that the results are highly statistically significant.
</p><h3>
2. Outline of the Procedure.</h3>
In this section we describe the test in outline. In an appendix,
sufficient details are provided to enable the reader to repeat the computations
precisely, and so to verify their correctness.

<p>We test the significance of the phenomenon on samples of pairs of related
words. To do this we must do the following:
</p><ol type="i">
<li>
define the notion of "distance" between any two words, so as to lend meaning
to the idea of words in "close proximity";</li>

<li>
define statistics that express how close, "on the whole," the words making
up the sample pairs are to each other (some kind of average over the whole
sample);</li>

<li>
choose a sample of pairs of related words on which to run the test; and</li>

<li>
determine whether the statistics defined in (ii) are "unusually small"
for the chosen sample.</li>
</ol>
Notice that the procedure here described is identical to that used in (Witztum
<i>et al</i>., 1994), except for minor changes in the details of task (i),
due to fact that here we consider "distance" between an ELS and a word
in the string of letters (SL) of the text, and not a "distance" between
two ELS's (as in Witztum <i>et al</i>., 1994).

<p>Task (i) has several components. First, we must define the notion of
"distance" between an ELS and an SL of the text in a given array; for this
we use a convenient variant of the ordinary Euclidean distance. Second,
there are many ways of writing a text as a two-dimenional array, depending
on the row length; we must select one or more of these arrays, and somehow
amalgamate the results (of course, the selection and/or amalgamation must
be carried out according to clearly stated, systematic rules). Third, a
given word may occur many times as an ELS in a text; here again, a selection
and amalgamation process is called for. Fourth, we must correct for factors
such as word length and composition. All this is done in detail in Sections
<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.1">A.1</a> and <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.2">A.2</a>
of the Appendix.

</p><p>Next, we have task (ii), measuring the overall proximity of pairs of
words in the sample as a whole. For this, we used two different statistics,
<i>P</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>, which are defined and motivated
in the Appendix (Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.6">A.6</a>). Intuitively,
each measures overall proximity in a different way. In each case, a small
value of <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> indicates that the words in the sample pairs
are, on the whole, close to each other.

</p><p>To accomplish task (iii) we composed three samples (<b><a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#B1">Sample
B1</a></b>, <b><a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#B2">Sample B2</a></b> and <b><a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#B3">Sample
B3</a></b>) of pairs of expressions (<i>w, w'</i>), where <i>w'</i>s are
words appearing as ELS's, and <i>w' '</i>s are words appearing as SL's
(i.e. with <i>d'</i> =<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/plus1.gif" height="10" width="11" align="BOTTOM">1).

</p><p>Preliminary test was done for each sample, in order to check how the
<i>subject</i> of the sample appears as ELS's and SL's in <i>Genesis</i>,
and consequently to decide whether to test the sample itself. For details
see Appendix, Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.3.1">A.3.1</a>.

</p><p><a name="B1"></a><b>Sample B1</b> is built on the basis of the Hebrew
alphabet. For every letter <i>'x'</i> of the Hebrew alphabet we consider
pairs (<i>w,w'</i>), where <i>w'</i> 's are found as SL's and have the
meaning "a name beginning with <i>'x' </i>" or "names beginning with <i>'x'
</i>", while <i>w'</i>s are names beginning with <i>'x'</i> taken from
"A Treasury of Men`s Names" (which is included as an appendix in Even-Shoshan's
famous Hebrew dictionary (Even-Shoshan, 1989). For a detailed definition
of the <b>Sample B1</b> see Appendix (Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.3.2">A.3.2</a>).

</p><p><a name="B2"></a><b>Sample B2</b> is built exactly in the same way as
Sample B1, except for the fact that the names are taken from "A Treasury
of Women's Names" from the same dictionary.

</p><p><a name="B3"></a><b>Sample B3</b> is built on the basis of the list
of the seventy descendents of Noah's sons: the Semites, the Hamites, and
the Japhetites, found in <i>Genesis </i>Chapter 10. Jewish tradition teaches,
that these seventy descendents became the Seventy Nations which constitute
Humanity. This concept is well known, and is usually found in biblical
Encyclopaedias under the title "The Table of Nations" (see for instance
<i>Encyclopedia Biblica,</i> 1962). <b>Sample B3</b> consists of pairs
(<i>w,</i> <i>w'</i>) where <i>w' '</i>s are names from this list, and
<i>w</i>`s are expressions from a fixed set of expressions describing basic
aspects of nationality (such as name, country, language etc.) For details
see Appendix, Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.3.3">A.3.3</a> and
<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table8">Table
8</a>.

</p><p>Finally, we come to Task (iv), the significant test itself. We apply
the same procedure for all three samples. For <b>Sample B3</b> we describe
it here: for the other two samples the (similar) details are given in Appendix
<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.4">A.4</a>.

</p><p>The list of Seventy Nations consists of 68 <i>different</i> names (in
two cases nations have the same name). For each of the 68! permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">
of these names, we define the statistic&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p1.gif" height="14" width="23" align="ABSBOTTOM">obtained
by permuting the names in accordance with&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">,
so that Name <i>i</i> is matched with the set of expressions defined for
Name&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">(<i>i</i>).
The 68! numbers&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p1.gif" height="14" width="23" align="ABSBOTTOM">
are ordered, with possible ties, according to the usual order of the real
numbers. If the phenomenon under study were due to chance, it would be
just as likely that <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> occupies any one of the 68! places
in this order as any other. Similarly for <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>. This is
our null hypothesis.

</p><p>To calculate significance levels, we chose 999,999 random
permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">
of the 68 names; the precise way in which this was done is explained in
the Appendix (Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.7">A.7</a>). Each of these
permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM"> determines
a statistic&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p1.gif" height="14" width="23" align="ABSBOTTOM"> 
together
with <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, we have thus 1,000,000 numbers. Define the <i>rank
order</i> of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, among these 1,000,000 numbers as the
number of&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p1.gif" height="14" width="23" align="ABSBOTTOM"> not
exceeding <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>; if <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> is tied with
other&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p1.gif" height="14" width="23" align="ABSBOTTOM">,
half of these others are considered to "exceed" P<sub>1</sub>.
Let&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sub1.gif" height="16" width="19" align="ABSCENTER">
be the rank order of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, divided by 1,000,000; under
the null
hypothesis,&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sub1.gif" height="16" width="19" align="ABSCENTER">
is the probability that <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> would rank as low as it does.
Define&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sub2.gif" height="16" width="21" align="ABSCENTER"> similarly
(using the same 999,999 permutations in each case).

</p><p>For <b>Sample B3</b> we performed an additional test with 999,999,999
random permutations. In this case only statistic&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p2.gif" height="14" width="20" align="ABSBOTTOM">
was calculated. The time needed for the computation of&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p1.gif" height="14" width="23" align="ABSBOTTOM"> for
999,999,999 random permutations is at present not within the reach of our
possibilties.

</p><p>After calculating the probabilities&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sub1.gif" height="16" width="19" align="ABSCENTER">
and&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sub2.gif" height="16" width="21" align="ABSCENTER">, we must
make an overall decision, for each sample, to accept or reject the null
hypothesis. Thus the overall significance level (or p-value) for each sample,
using the two statistics. is&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sub.gif" height="16" width="18" align="ABSCENTER"> :=
2 min <img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/subi.gif" height="16" width="19" align="ABSCENTER">.

3. Results and Conclusions.</h3>
In Tables <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html">1</a>, <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table2">2</a>
and <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table3">3</a> we present the results for the three
samples. <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html">Table 1</a> shows the results for <b>Sample
B1</b>. There we list the rank order of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>

Thus the entry 1139 for <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> means that for 1138 out of
the 999,999 random permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">,
the statistic&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/p2.gif" height="14" width="20" align="ABSBOTTOM">was
smaller than <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>. It follows that

</p><h2> APPENDIX: Details of the Procedure.</h2>

In this Appendix we describe the procedure in sufficient detail to enable
the reader to repeat the computations precisely. Some motivation for the
various definitions is also provided.

<p>In Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.1">A.1</a> of this Appendix, a "raw" measure
of distance between words is defined. Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.2">A.2</a> explains
how we normalize this raw measure to correct for factors like the length
of a word and its composition (the relative frequency of the letters occurring
in it). Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.3">A.3</a> explains how the three samples B1,
B2 and B3 are constructed. Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.5">A.5</a> identifies the
precise text, of Genesis that we used. In Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.6">A.6</a>,
we define and motivate the statistics <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>.
The details of the task (iv) are described in Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.4">A.4</a>.
Finally, Section <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.7">A.7</a> provides the details of the randomization.
</p><h5>
<a name="A.1"></a>A.1 The Distance Between Words.</h5>
To define the "distance" between words, we must first define the distance
between an ELS representing a word and a string of letters (SL) in the
text, (i.e. with <i>d</i> =&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/plus1.gif" height="10" width="11" align="BOTTOM">1)
representing the other word. Before we can do that, we must define the
distance between ELS and SL in a given array: and before we can do that,
we must define the distance between individual letters in the array.

<p>As indicated in Section 1, we think of an array as one long line that
spirals down on a cylinder; its <i>row length h</i> is the number of vertical
columns. To define the distance between two letters <i>x </i>and <i>x'</i>,
cut the cylinder along a vertical line between two columns. In the resulting
plane each of <i>x</i> and <i>x'</i> have two integer coordinates. and
we compute the distance between them as usual, using these coordinates.
In general, there are two possible values for this distance, depending
on the vertical line that was chosen for cutting the cylinder; if the two
values are different, we use the smaller one.

</p><p>Next, we define the distance between fixed ELS <i>e</i> and SL <i>e'</i>
in a fixed cylindrical array. Set
</p><ul><i>f</i> := the distance between consecutive letters of <i>e,</i>

<p><i>f '</i> := the distance between consecutive letters of <i>e' </i>=
1.

</p><p><i>l</i> := the minimal distance between a letter of <i>e</i> and one
of <i>e'</i>,</p></ul>
and define&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/d.gif" height="12" width="9" align="BOTTOM">(<i>e,
e'</i>) := <i>f</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>f'</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>l</i><sup>2</sup>+1.
We call&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/d.gif" height="12" width="9" align="BOTTOM">(<i>e, e'</i>)
the <i>distance</i> between the ELS <i>e </i>and the SL <i>e'</i> in the
given array; it is small if both fit into a relatively compact area.

<p>Now there are many ways of writing Genesis as a cylindrical array, depending
on the row length <i>h</i>. Denote by&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/d.gif" height="12" width="9" align="BOTTOM"><i><sub>h</sub></i>(<i>e,
e'</i>) the distance&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/d.gif" height="12" width="9" align="BOTTOM">(<i>e,
e'</i>) in the array determined by <i>h</i>, and set&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/u.gif" height="12" width="12" align="ABSCENTER"><i><sub>h</sub></i>(<i>e,
e'</i>) := 1/<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/d.gif" height="12" width="9" align="BOTTOM"><i><sub>h</sub></i>(<i>e,
e'</i>); the larger&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/u.gif" height="12" width="12" align="ABSCENTER"><i><sub>h</sub></i>(<i>e,
e'</i>) is, the more compact is the configuration consisting of <i>e </i>and
<i>e'</i> in the array with row length <i>h</i>. Set <i>e</i> = (<i>n,
d, k</i>) (recall that <i>d </i>is the skip). Of particular interest are
the row lengths <i>h</i> = <i>h</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>2</sub>,....
where <i>h<sub>i</sub></i> is the integer nearest to |<i>d</i>| /<i>i</i>
(1/2 is rounded up). Thus when <i>h</i> = <i>h</i><sub>1</sub> = |d|, then
<i>e </i>appears as a column of adjacent letters and when <i>h</i> = <i>h</i><sub>2</sub>,
then <i>e</i> appears either as a column that skips alternate rows or as
a straight line of knight's moves. In general, the arrays in which <i>e
</i>appears relatively compactly are those with row length <i>h<sub>i</sub></i>
with <i>i</i> "not too large."

</p><p>The above discussion indicates that if there is an array in which the
configuration (<i>e,e'</i>) is unusually compact, it is likely to be among
those whose row length is one of the first ten <i>h<sub>i</sub></i>. (Here
and in the sequel 10 is an arbitrarily selected "moderate" number). So
setting
</p><center><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/eq1.gif" height="44" width="145"></center>


<p>we conclude that&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/o.gif" height="7" width="11" align="BOTTOM">(<i>e,
e'</i>) is a reasonable measure of the maximal "compactness" of the configuration
(<i>e, e'</i>) in any array. Equivalently, it is an inverse measure of
the minimum distance between <i>e </i>and <i>e'</i>.

</p><p>Next, given a word <i>w</i>, we look for the most "noteworthy" occurrence
or occurrences of <i>w </i>as an ELS in <i>G</i>. For this, we chose ELS's
<i>e</i> = (<i>n,d,k</i>) with |<i>d</i>|&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/great.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
2 that spell out <i>w </i>for which |<i>d</i>| is minimal over all of <i>G</i>,
or at least over large portions of it. Specifically, define the <i>domain
of minimality</i> of <i>e </i>as the maximal segment <i>T<sub>e</sub></i>
of <i>G </i>that includes <i>e </i>and does not include any other ELS&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/ebar.gif" height="18" width="69" align="BOTTOM">
for <i>w</i> with |<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/dbar.gif" height="14" width="13">|&lt; |<i>d</i>|.
The length of <i>T<sub>e</sub></i>, relative to the whole of <i>G</i>,
is the "weight" we assign to <i>e</i>. Thus we define&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/w.gif" height="8" width="13" align="BOTTOM">(<i>e</i>)
:=&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gimmel.gif" height="16" width="10" align="BOTTOM">(<i>T<sub>e</sub></i>)/<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gimmel.gif" height="16" width="10" align="BOTTOM">(<i>G</i>),
where&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gimmel.gif" height="16" width="10" align="BOTTOM">(<i>T<sub>e</sub></i>)
is the length of <i>T<sub>e</sub></i>, and&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gimmel.gif" height="16" width="10" align="BOTTOM">(<i>G</i>)
is the length of <i>G</i>. For any two words <i>w</i> and <i>w',</i> we set
</p><center><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/eq2.gif" height="32" width="252"></center>


<p>where the sum is over all ELS's <i>e </i>spelling out <i>w </i>and over
all SL's <i>e</i>' spelling out <i>w'</i>. Roughly,&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,
w'</i>) measures the maximum closeness of the more noteworthy appearances
of <i>w </i>as ELS's and <i>w'</i> as SL's in Genesis--the closer they
are, the larger is&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,
w'</i>).

</p><p>When actually computing&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,
w'</i>), the size of the list of ELS's for <i>w </i>may be impractically
large (especially for short words). It is clear from the definition of
the domain of minimality that ELS's for <i>w </i>with relatively large
skips will contribute very little to the value of&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>)
due to their small weight. Hence, in order to cut the amount of computation
we restrict beforehand the range of the skip |<i>d</i>|<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"><i>D</i>(<i>w</i>)
for <i>w </i>so that the expected number of ELS's for <i>w</i> will be
10. This expected number equals the product of the relative frequencies
(within Genesis) of the letters constituting <i>w </i>multiplied by the
total number of all equidistant letter sequences with 2&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM">|<i>d</i>|<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM">
<i>D</i>. (The latter is given by the formula (<i>D </i>- 1)(2<i>L</i>
- (<i>k</i> - 1)(<i>D</i> + 2)), where <i>L</i> is the length of the text
and <i>k</i> is the number of letters in <i>w</i>). Abusing our notation
somewhat, we continue to denote this modified function by&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>).
</p><h5>
<a name="A.2"></a>A.2 The Corrected Distance.</h5>
In the previous section we defined a measure&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,
w'</i>) of proximity between two words <i>w </i>and <i>w'</i> -- an inverse
measure of the distance between them. We are, however, interested less
in the absolute distance between two words, than in whether this distance
is larger or smaller than "expected". In this section, we define a "relative
distance" <i>c</i>(<i>w, w'</i>), which is small when <i>w </i>is "unusually
close" to <i>w',</i> and is 1, or almost 1, when <i>w </i>is "unusually
far" from <i>w'</i>.

<p>The idea is to use perturbations of the arithmetic progressions that
define the notion of an ELS. Specifically, start by fixing a triple (<i>x,y,z</i>)
of integers in the range {-<i>r</i>,...,0,...,<i>r</i>}; there are (2<i>r
</i>+ 1)<sup>3 </sup>such triples. In Witztum <i>et al</i>. (1994) and
also here we put <i>r </i>= 2. which gives us 125 triples. Next, rather
than looking for ordinary ELS's (<i>n,d,k</i>), look for "(<i>x,y,z</i>)-perturbed
ELS's" (<i>n,d,k</i>)<sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup> obtained by taking the positions
</p><center><i>n, n + d,...,n + </i>(<i>k - </i>4)<i>d, n + </i>(<i>k - </i>3)<i>d
+ x, n + </i>(<i>k - </i>2)<i>d + x + y, n + </i>(<i>k - </i>1)<i>d + x
+ y + z,</i></center>


<p>instead of the positions <i>n, n + d, n +2d,...,n +(k - </i>1<i>)d</i>.
Note that in a word of length <i>k, k-</i>2 intervals could be perturbed.
However, we preferred to perturb only the 3 last ones, for technical programming
reasons.

</p><p>The <i>distance </i>between the (<i>x,y,z</i>)-peturbed ELS (<i>n, d,
k)</i><sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup> and the SL (<i>n'</i>,&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/plus1.gif" height="10" width="11" align="BOTTOM">1,<i>k'</i>)
is defined by the same formulae as in the non-perturbed case, where <i>f</i>
is taken to be the distance between the first two letters of (<i>x,y,z</i>)-perturbed
<i>e</i>.

</p><p>We may now calculate the "(<i>x,y,z</i>)-proximity" of two words <i>w
</i>and <i>w'</i> in a manner exactly analogous to that used for calculating
the "ordinary" proximity&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,
w'</i>). This yields 125 numbers&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM"><sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup>(<i>w,
w'</i>), of which&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>)=<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM"><sup>(0,0,0)</sup>(<i>w,w'</i>)
is one. We are interested in only some of these 125 numbers; namely, those
corresponding to triples (<i>x,y,z</i>) for which there actually exist
some (<i>x,y,z</i>)-perturbed ELS's in Genesis for <i>w </i>(the other&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM"><sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup>(<i>w,w'</i>)
vanish). Denote by <i>M</i>(<i>w, w'</i>) the set of all such triples,
and by <i>m</i>(<i>w, w'</i>) the number of its elements.

</p><p>Suppose (0,0,0) is in <i>M</i>(<i>w, w'</i>), i.e., <i>w</i> actually
appears as ordinary ELS (i.e., with <i>x = y = z = </i>0) in the text.
Denote by <i>v</i>(<i>w,w'</i>) the number of triples (<i>x,y,z</i>) in
<i>M</i>(<i>w,w'</i>) for which&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM"><sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup>(<i>w,w'</i>)<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/great.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>).
If <i>m</i>(<i>w,w'</i>)<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/great.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"> 10
(again, 10 is an arbitrarily selected "moderate" number),
</p><center><i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>) :=<i>v</i>(<i>w,w'</i>)/<i>m</i>(<i>w,w'</i>).</center>


<p>If (0, 0,0) is not in <i>M</i>(<i>w, w'</i>), or if <i>m</i>(<i>w, w'</i>)
&lt; 10 (in which case we consider the accuracy of the method as insufficient),
we do not define <i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>).

</p><p>In words, the corrected distance <i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>) is simply the
rank order of the proximity&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>)
among all the "perturbed proximities"&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM"><sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup>(<i>w,w'</i>);
if&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>)
is tied with other&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM"><sup>(<i>x,y,z</i>)</sup>(<i>w,w'</i>),
half of these others are considered to "exceed"&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/epsilon.gif" height="10" width="14" align="BOTTOM">(<i>w,w'</i>).
We normalize it so that the maximum distance is 1. A large corrected distance
means that ELS's representing <i>w</i> are far away from the SL's representing
<i>w'</i>, on a scale determined by how far the <i>perturbed </i>ELS's
for <i>w </i>are from the SL's for <i>w'</i>.
</p><h5>
<a name="A.3"></a>A.3 The Samples of Word Pairs.</h5>
In this Section we describe the three samples that were tested in this
research. Each of them consists of pairs of expressions (<i>w,w'</i>),
where according to our procedure, we are looking for <i>w</i> to appear
as ELS's and for <i>w'</i> to appear as SL's.

<p>Our method of rank ordering of ELS's based on (<i>x,y,z</i>)-perturbations
requires that words have at least 5 letters to apply the perturbations.
In addition, we found that for words with more than 8 letters, the number
of (<i>x,y,z</i>)-perturbed ELS's which actually exist for such words was
too small to satisfy our criteria for applying the corrected distance.
Thus the words in our list are restricted in length to the range 5-8, exactly
as in Witztum <i>et al</i>. (1994). However. there is no restriction on
the words or expressions appearing as SL's.

</p><p><a name="A.3.1"></a><i>A.3.1 Preliminary Tests.</i>
<br>Sample B1 deals with men's names. Appendix B in Even-Shoshan's Hebrew
dictionary (Even-Shoshan. 1989) is "A Treasury of Private Names". It is
divided into two parts: "A Treasury of Men's Names" and "A Treasury of
Women's Names". Originally, we intented to check a sample based on the
(much bigger) Treasury of men's names. The Treasury contains names from
the Hebrew Bible and from various periods of the Hebrew language. We decided
to include in our sample only names taken from the Hebrew Bible (they are
indicated as such in this Treasury). These are original Hebrew names, or
names which are etymologically Semitic or Hebrew. (See the foreword to
the Treasury).

</p><p>We describe the <i>subject </i>of the sample by the following set of
pairs of expressions:

<br>Chapter 10 of <i>Genesis </i>contains the names of the seventy descendents
of Noah's sons: the Semites, the Hamites and the Japhetites
(see <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table8">Table
8</a>). Jewish tradition teaches, that these seventy descendents became
the Seventy Nations, which constitute Humanity. The source for this tradition
is found in <i>Targum Yonathan</i> (Jonathan's Translation) to <i>Deuteronomy
</i>32:8 (see Kasher, 1983, p.294). This concept is well known, and is
found in biblical Encyclopedias under the title "the Table of Nations"
(see for instance, <i>Encyclopedia Biblica</i>, 1962).

</p><p>Jewish tradition further tells us (Hagra, 1905), that a nation has the
following four characteristics:
</p><ol>
<li>
its name,</li>

<li>
its country,</li>

<li>
its language.</li>

<li>
its script.</li>
</ol>
Sample B3 is constructed on the basis of the "Table of Nations" using these
four categories. Let us denote
<center><i>TN</i>:= the Table of Nations</center>


<p>For every <i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/in.gif" height="9" width="11" align="ABSCENTER"><i>TN
</i>we define below a set <i>List B</i>3(<i>x</i>) of expressions.

<p>Now let us explain how <i>List B3</i>(<i>x</i>) is constructed. Take,

(the <i>Canaanites</i>).</li>

<li>
For the <i>Country</i> of Canaan there is the Biblical expression:<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/canan.gif" height="13" width="31" align="ABSBOTTOM">&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/eretz.gif" height="13" width="29" align="ABSBOTTOM">.</li>

but it is a Biblical formation.</li>
</ol>
In the course of history names of nations and countries changed. In certain
cases, the Jewish tradition, as expressed by <i>Targum Yonathan</i> to
<i>Genesis </i>, gives the new names for the nations and countries under
consideration. We add these new names to the corresponding categories (1)
and (2). Thus, for example, the new name for Javan (item 4 in
<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table8">Table
8</a>) is&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/mac.gif" height="11" width="51" align="ABSBOTTOM">
(Macedonia), whereas for Canaan there are no new names.

<p>The same procedure is applied to each name from the Table of Nations.
For every
<br><i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/in.gif" height="9" width="11" align="ABSCENTER"><i>
TN</i> List B3 (<i>x</i>) consists of the following expressions:
</p><ol>
<li>
'<i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/am.gif" height="11" width="20" align="BOTTOM">'
(the nation of <i>x</i>),

of <i>x</i>), NewNationName(<i>x</i>);</li>

'<i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/ktav.gif" height="10" width="27" align="BOTTOM">'
(the script of <i>x</i>).</li>
</ol>
In <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table8">Table 8</a> for every name
<i>x&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/in.gif" height="9" width="11" align="ABSCENTER">
TN </i>the corresponding List B3(<i>x</i>) is given.

<p><i>Remark 1.</i> The expressions '<i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/am.gif" height="11" width="20" align="BOTTOM">',
'<i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/eretz.gif" height="13" width="29" align="ABSBOTTOM">'<i>
</i>and '<i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sfat.gif" height="10" width="30" align="BOTTOM">'
were chosen for categories (1), (2) and (3) because at least for some <i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/in.gif" height="9" width="11" align="ABSCENTER"><i>
TN</i> they appear as Biblical expressions (see the above example of Canaan).
For category (4) we used '<i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/ktav.gif" height="10" width="27" align="BOTTOM">';
although it does not appear for any <i>x</i>&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/in.gif" height="9" width="11" align="ABSCENTER"><i>
TN,</i> it is the only Biblical formation suitable for this category.

</p><p><i>Remark 2.</i> Concerning the expressions '<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/im.gif" height="10" width="16" align="BOTTOM">-<i>x
</i>', we are aware of the fact that only valid lingustic formations should
be used; therefore we use these expressions if, at least, their singular
form '<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/yud.gif" height="10" width="7" align="BOTTOM">-<i>x'</i>
appears in the Hebrew Bible. For instance, for&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gmar.gif" height="10" width="24" align="BOTTOM">
(item 1) we do not take&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/im.gif" height="10" width="16" align="BOTTOM"><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gmar.gif" height="10" width="24" align="BOTTOM">, since the
expression&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/yud.gif" height="10" width="7" align="BOTTOM"><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/gmar.gif" height="10" width="24" align="BOTTOM">
does not appear in the Hebrew Bible; so we cannot know whether it has any
meaning at all. The check was done using Even-Shoshan's <i>New Concordance
of the Bible</i> (Even-Shoshan, 1981).

</p><p><i>Remark 3.</i> In Talmudic Literature we find various new names for
nations and countries, and we cannot decide in favor of one against the
other. We preferred to use a single source. The Aramaic translation of
<i>Genesis </i>that gives the largest number of such new names is <i>Targum
Yonathan</i>. We used <i>Targum Yonathan</i> as printed in <i>Torah</i>
<i>Shelemah</i> (Kasher, 1929) (with <i>Torah Shelemah</i>'s corrections
according to the Ginzburger manuscript and others).

</p><p><i>Targum Yonathan</i> identifies the new name for the country for items
1 to 15, 17, and 19 to 23 in <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/tables.html#table8">Table 8</a>; and
the new name for the nation for items 24 to 33, and 41 to 44.

</p><p><i>Targum Yonathan</i> is a translation into Aramaic. We need the identification
of the names, but we do not intend to check whether the Aramaic appears
non-randomly as ELS's. Thus, where the Hebrew formation exists, we used
it alone.

</p><p><i>Remark 4.</i> Here, as in Witztum <i>et al</i>. (1994), we used the
grammatical orthogrophy - <i>ktiv dikduki.</i>
</p><h5>
<a name="A.4"></a>A.4 The Permutations.</h5>
Here we define the permuted samples for B1, B2 and B3.

<p><i>A.4.1 Samples B1 and B2.</i>

</p><p>Let&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM"> be a permutation
on the set <i>HA'</i>. Then we define the permuted sample
</p><center><i>Sample B</i>1(<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">):=&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/ueq.gif" height="30" width="35" align="ABSCENTER">
<i>Pair B</i>1(<i>x,<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM"></i>(<i>x</i>)).</center>


<p>The set <i>HA'</i> consists of 12 elements, thus there are 12! different
permutations. To calculate significance levels, we chose 999,999 random
permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM"> as
described in <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.7">Section A.7</a>.

</p><p>For Sample B2 we proceed similarly.

</p><p><i>A.4.2 Sample B3.</i>

</p><p>For a permutation&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">
on the set <i>TN</i> we define the permuted sample
</p><center><i>Sample B</i>3(<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">)
:=&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/ueq1.gif" height="32" width="34" align="CENTER"><i>Pair B</i>3(<i>x</i>,<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">(<i>x</i>)).</center>


<p>The set <i>TN </i>consists of 68 different elements (the names&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sheba.gif" height="10" width="31" align="BOTTOM">and&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/choliah.gif" height="12" width="39" align="BOTTOM">
appear twice), thus there are 68! different permutations. To calculate
significance levels, we first chose 999,999 random permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">
as described in <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.6">Section A.6</a>. Then we did a new measurement
which 999,999,999 random permutations, only for statistic <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>.
</p><h5>
<a name="A.5"></a>A.5 The Text.</h5>
We used the standard, generally accepted text of Genesis known as the "Textus
Receptus." One widely available edition is that of the Koren Publishing
Company in Jerusalem. The Koren text is precisely the same as that used
by us.
<h5>
<a name="A.6"></a>A.6 The Overall Proximity Measures <i><font size="+0">P</font></i><sub>1</sub>
and <i><font size="+0">P</font></i><sub>2</sub>.</h5>
Let <i>N </i>be the number of word pairs (<i>w, w'</i>) in the sample for
which the corrected distance <i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>) is defined (see <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.2">Section
A.2</a> and <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/Nations/WRR2/#A.3">A.3</a> above). Let <i>k b</i>e the number of
such word pairs (<i>w,w'</i>) for which <i>c</i>(<i>w, w'</i>)&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"> 1/5.
Define <center><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/eq3.gif" height="40" width="159"></center>


<p>To understand this definition, note that <i>if </i>the <i>c</i>(<i>w,
w'</i>) were independent random variables that are uniformly distributed
over [0,1], <i>then</i> <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> would be the probability that
at least <i>k </i>out of <i>N </i>of them are&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"> 0.2.
However, we do <i>not </i>make or use any such assumptions about uniformity
and independence. Thus <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, though calibrated in probability
terms, is simply an ordinal index that measures the number of word pairs
in a given sample whose words are "pretty close" to each other (i.e. <i>c</i>(<i>w,
w'</i>)&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"> 1/5),
taking into account the size of the whole sample. It enables us to compare
the overall proximity of the word pairs in different samples; specifically,
in the samples arising from the different permutations&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pi.gif" height="9" width="11" align="BOTTOM">.

</p><p>The statistic <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> ignores all distances <i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>)
greater than 0.2, and gives equal weight to all distances less than 0.2.
For a measure that is sensitive to the actual size of the distances, we
calculate the product&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pimaj.gif" height="14" width="15" align="BOTTOM"><i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>)
over all word pairs (<i>w,w'</i>) in the sample. We then define
</p><center><i>P</i><sub>2</sub> := <i>F<sup>N</sup></i> (<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pimaj.gif" height="14" width="15" align="BOTTOM"><i>c</i>(<i>w,
w'</i>)),</center>


<p>with <i>N</i> as above, and
</p><center><img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/eq4.gif" height="40" width="370"></center>


<p>To understand this definition, note first that if <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>x<sub>N</sub> </i>are independent random
variables that are uniformly distributed over [O, 1], then the distribution
of their product <i>X</i> :=<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>...<i>x<sub>N</sub></i>
is given by Prob(<i>X&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/less.gif" height="13" width="10" align="BOTTOM"> X</i><sub>0</sub>)
= <i>F</i><sup>N</sup>(<i>X</i><sub>0</sub>); this follows from (3.5) in
Feller (1966), since the -ln <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> are distributed exponentially,
and -ln <i>X </i>=&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/sig.gif" height="17" width="20" align="ABSCENTER">(-ln
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>). The intuition for <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> is then analogous
to that for <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>: If the <i>c</i>(<i>w, w'</i>) were independent
random variables that are uniformly distributed over [0,1], <i>then</i>
<i>P</i><sub>2</sub> would be the probability that the product&nbsp;<img src="./Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis_files/pimaj.gif" height="14" width="15" align="BOTTOM"><i>c</i>(<i>w,w'</i>)
is as small as it is, or smaller. But as before, we do not use any such
uniformity, or independence assumptions. Like <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, the
statistic <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> is calibrated in probability terms; but
rather than thinking of it as a probability, one should think of it simply
as an ordinal index that enables us to compare the proximity of the words
in word pairs arising from different permutations.

<a name="A.7"></a>A.7 The Randomizations.</h5>
The 999,999 random permutations for the three tests were chosen in accordance
with Algorithm <i>P </i>of Knuth (Knuth: 1969, page 125). The pseudorandom
generator required as input to this algorithm was that provided by Turbo-Pascal
5.0 of Borland Inter Inc. We used the same seed as in Witztum <i>et al.</i>
(1994): 01001 10000 10011 11100 00101 00111 11.

<p>The control text <i>V </i>was constructed by permuting the verses of
<i>G</i> with a single random permutation, generated like in the previous
paragraph. In this case, the seed was picked arbitrarily to be the decimal
integer 10 (i.e., the binary integer 1010).
